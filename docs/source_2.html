A dungeon is a kind of room. A dungeon is usually dark.
<br>
The Cellar is a dungeon. The Cellar is west of a dungeon called Troll Room.  &quot;<font color=#000080>You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading east, and a crawlway to the south.  On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.</font>&quot;

Check going west while in Cellar: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You attempt to climb the ramp, but it is too slippery, and you slide back down.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
The description of Troll Room is &quot;<font color=#000080>This is a small room with passages off in all directions. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>walls.</font>&quot;
<br>
A man called the Troll is in Troll Room.  The initial appearance of the Troll is &quot;<font color=#000080>[if the troll is consious]A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.[otherwise]There is an unconsious troll here.[end if]</font>&quot;.
<br>
Check going when the player can see the consious Troll:

  say &quot;<font color=#000080>and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does not look pleased.</font>&quot;;
<br>

<br>
else;
<br>
  say &quot;<font color=#000080>and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.</font>&quot;;

</font><font color=#000080>of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>carcass has disappeared.</font>&quot;;
<br>

<br>
West of a dungeon called West of Chasm is south of Cellar. &quot;<font color=#000080>You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen.

<br>
A dungeon called Gallery is south of West of Chasm. &quot;<font color=#000080>This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through the north, south, or west exits.</font>&quot;
