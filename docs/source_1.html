Instead of opening the trap door when the player is in the Cellar and exit found is false:
<br>
 say &quot;<font color=#000080>The trap door is locked from above.</font>&quot;
<br>
Instead of looking under the rug: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There's a trap door under the rug.</font>&quot;
<br>
Instead of going through the closed trap door: say &quot;<font color=#000080>The trap door is closed.</font>&quot;
<br>
Instead of taking the rug: say &quot;<font color=#000080>The rug is too heavy to lift.</font>&quot;
<br>
After pushing or pulling the rug for the first time: say &quot;<font color=#000080>With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room. With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.</font>&quot;; now the trap door is revealed.
<br>
After pushing or pulling the rug: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible to move it again.</font>&quot;

Southeast of Forest 2 is west of a room called Canyon View.  South from Canyon View is east of Forest 5.  The description of Canyon View is &quot;<font color=#000080>You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here there is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>appear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Down from Canyon View is a room called Rocky Ledge.  The description of Rocky Ledge is &quot;<font color=#000080>You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>climbable.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Down from Rocky Ledge is a room called Canyon Bottom.  The description of Canyon Bottom is &quot;<font color=#000080>You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>runoff of Aragain Falls. To the north is a narrow path.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
North of Canyon Bottom is southeast of a room called End of Rainbow.  The description of End of Rainbow is &quot;<font color=#000080>You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs.  The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west and a narrow path continues to the southeast.</font>&quot;
