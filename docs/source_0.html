change description entry to &quot;<font color=#000080>Welcome to Zork![paragraph break]   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast quantities of treasure.  Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.  In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon. To receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy case in the living room of the house.[paragraph break]   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons, since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>is rumored to be useful.[paragraph break]   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept. When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed, which you may do only twice.[paragraph break]   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).</font>&quot;.

<A name="note1"><font color=#404040>[1]. According to THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE --  FLAMMABLE: An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives. The common word meaning "combustible" is inflammable. But some people are thrown off by the in- and think inflammable means "not combustible." For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or explosives are now marked FLAMMABLE. Unless you are operating such a truck and hence are concerned with the safety of children and illiterates, use inflammable.</font><p>
<A name="note2"><font color=#404040>[2].  It is absurd that the adventurer would be able to count so many leaves with such precision, especially in the minute or so time that a normal turn supposedly takes.</font><p>
<A name="note3"><font color=#404040>[3].  Decimal 69 is equal to octal 105, and hexadecimal 69 is equal to decimal 105.</font><p>
<A name="note4"><font color=#404040>[4].  Mind! I donâ€™t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a doorâ€“nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffinâ€“nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Countryâ€™s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a doorâ€“nail. --Charles Dickens</font><p>
<A name="note5"><font color=#404040>[5].  OK, this sort of doesn't make sense if the player is outside</font><p>
