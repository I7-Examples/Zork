<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>. According to THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE --  FLAMMABLE: An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives. The common word meaning "combustible" is inflammable. But some people are thrown off by the in- and think inflammable means "not combustible." For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or explosives are now marked FLAMMABLE. Unless you are operating such a truck and hence are concerned with the safety of children and illiterates, use inflammable.</span></p>

I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country-s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail. --Charles Dickens</span></p>
