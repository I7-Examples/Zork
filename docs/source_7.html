<br>

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>[8 spaces]'Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here.'[paragraph break]
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.</font>&quot;
<br>
Down from Cave1 is Entrance to Hades. Land of the Living Dead is a dungeon. East of Entrance to Hades is Land of the Living Dead.
<br>
The description of Land of the Living Dead is &quot;<font color=#000080>You have entered the Land of the Living Dead, a large desolate room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In the east corner are
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers who were less
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>fortunate than yourself.  To the east is an ornate passage,
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>apparently recently constructed.  A passage exits to the west.</font>&quot;
<br>
East of the Land of the Living Dead is a dungeon called Tomb of the Unknown Implementor.  The description of Tomb of the Unknown Implementor is &quot;<font color=#000080>This is the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer. A hollow voice says:  'That's not a bug, it's a feature!'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It is made of the finest marble, and apparently large enough for four headless corpses.  The crypt is [if the crypt is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].  Above the entrance is the cryptic instruction: 'Feel Free'.</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>

<br>
The crypt door is a door.  The crypt door is closed.  The crypt door is north of the Tomb of the Unknown Implementor.  The Crypt of the Implementors is a dark room. The Crypt of the Implementors is north of the crypt door.  The description of the Crypt of the Implementors is &quot;<font color=#000080>Though large and aesthetically pleasing the marble crypt is empty; the sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasure to be expected in a tomb of this magnificence are missing. Inscribed on one wall is the motto of the implementers, 'Feel Free'.  There is a door leading out of the crypt to the south.  The door is [if the crypt is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].</font>&quot;.
<br>
Instead of opening the crypt door when the score is less than 616:
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>Although the implementers are dead, they foresaw that some cretin
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>punish such actions.</font>&quot;;
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>your most grievous sin, we shall deprive you of all your valuables,
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>and of your life.</font>&quot;;

end the game in death.
<br>
Every turn when the player is in Crypt of the Implementors:
<br>
if in darkness for the first turn begin;
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.  
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you,
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>and says, 'You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INCANT '&lt;word&gt;'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INCANT '&lt;word&gt; &lt;phrase&gt;'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Good luck, and choose wisely!'</font>&quot;;

Exorcism flag is a number that varies.
<br>

<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>Ding Dong.[paragraph break]</font>&quot;;
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>you.  On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>takes shape.</font>&quot;;
<br>
if the candles are flaming begin;
<br>
try silently dropping the candles;
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).</font>&quot;;

    say &quot;<font color=#000080>[description of the black book][paragraph break]</font>&quot;;
<br>
    say &quot;<font color=#000080>Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>confusion.  As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding,
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>speaks: 'Begone, fiends!'.  A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.</font>&quot;;
<br>
    change exorcism flag to -1;

  end if.
<br>
The description of the crypt door is &quot;<font color=#000080>Here lie the implementers, whose heads were placed on poles by the Keeper of the Dungeon for amazing untastefulness.</font>&quot; The crypt door is scenery.  
<br>

The initial appearance of the set of poled heads is &quot;<font color=#000080>There are four heads here, mounted securely on poles.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>HEADS</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>HEAD</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>POLE</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>POLES</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>PDL</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>BKD</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>TAA</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>MARC</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>IMPLEMENTORS</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>LOSER</font>&quot; as the set of poled heads.
<br>
Instead of taking or destroying or attacking or kicking or poking the set of poled heads:
<br>
say &quot;<font color=#000080>Although the implementers are dead, they foresaw that some cretin

<br>
The size of the stack of listings is 70.  The initial appearance of the stack of listings is 
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
