<br>
  say &quot;<font color=#000080>Oh dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a torch in here.</font>&quot;;

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in a dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect and the label translates to START.  The switch does not appear to be manipulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4 inch).  On
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>the front of the machine is a large lid, which is [if the machine is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].</font>&quot;

  say &quot;<font color=#000080>You'll cannot manipulate the switch with your hands.</font>&quot;
<br>
Carry out turning the switch with something:

  if the second noun is not the screwdriver begin;
<br>
    say &quot;<font color=#000080>It seems that [a second noun] won't do.</font>&quot;;
<br>
  else if the PDP-10 is open;
<br>
    say &quot;<font color=#000080>The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.</font>&quot;;
<br>
  else;
<br>
    say &quot;<font color=#000080>The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the excitement abates.</font>&quot;;
<br>
    if the pile of coal is in the PDP-10 begin;
<br>
      remove the junk;
<br>
      now the diamond is in the PDP-10;

<br>
The case-points of the huge diamond is 6.  Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>enormous</font>&quot; as the huge diamond.
<br>
After taking the huge diamond for the first time:
<br>
  award 10 points; continue the action.
<br>
Instead of taking the slag:  say &quot;<font color=#000080>The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial, and crumbles into dust at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.</font>&quot;
<br>
The capacity of the PDP-10 is 50.
<br>
A screwdriver is a thing.
